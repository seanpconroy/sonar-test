This is a test with a txt file to see if GitGuardian can find anything:
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

Now we can try with random azure stuff copied from online:
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"

    # rather than defining this inline, the Access Key can also be sourced
    # from an Environment Variable - more information is available below.
    access_key = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789..."
  }
}

Some simple username and passwords:
username = "Sean"
password = "find_me_please
